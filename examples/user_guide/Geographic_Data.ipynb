    "The plot API also has support for geographic data built on top of Cartopy and GeoViews. Both can be installed using conda with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda install -c pyviz geoviews\n",

    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare a geographic plot we have to supply a ``cartopy.crs.CRS`` (or coordinate reference system).  Coordinate reference systems are described in the [GeoViews documentation](http://geoviews.org/user_guide/Projections.html) and the full list of available CRSs is in the [cartopy documentation](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/v0.15/crs/projections.html). Only certain HoloPlot types support geographic coordinates, currently including: 'points', 'image', 'quadmesh', 'contour' and 'contourf'.\n",

As you can see above, a QuadMesh will project each original bin or pixel into the correct non-rectangular shape, accurately showing the geographic extent covered by each sample. An Image, on the other hand, will always be rectangularly aligned in the 2D plan, which requires warping and resampling the data in a way that allows efficient display but loses accuracy at the pixel level.  Rendering a large QuadMesh using Bokeh can be very slow, but there are two useful alternatives for datasets too large to be practical as native QuadMeshes.\n",
